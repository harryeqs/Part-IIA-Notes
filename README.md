## Intro

Hi there! I am an Information and Computer Engineer from Selwyn matriculated in 2022. I created these notes for revision for the 2025-2026 Part IIA Tripos and would like to share them to help people taking similar modules.

The F modules and Maths notes were word-processed in Markdown using Obsidian. Other modules will (hopefully) be uploaded soon, some of which may be in the form of hand-written PDFs.

Hope these notes can help you with your revision.

Please contact me either via my email yeqianshuo03@outlook.com or create an issue if you spot any mistakes or anything that can be improved on.

If you find these notes useful, please leave this repo a star ‚≠ê, THANKS!

HAPPY REVISION :)
